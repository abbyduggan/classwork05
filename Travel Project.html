		<h1> Marieta's Beautiful Hidden Beach </h1>
		<hr />
		<p> <!--paragraph 1--> Why not take a trip down to Mexico and visit the gorgeous hidden beach of Marieta? 
		This vacation spot is covered by a sandy cavern with a large hole facing the sky, but look out! You might miss it!
		It is completely invisible from the outside; <img src="../Desktop/hiddenbeach.jpeg" width="4320" height="3240" alt="hiddenbeach"> title="A view of the beach." />
		it can only be accessed through a water tunnel that links the beach to 
		the Pacific Ocean. Its strange shape can be linked to bomb testings in the early 1900s, thought to be 
		an ideal spot uninhabited by the Mexican people. Ideal for canoeing and kayaking, this hidden beach is one thing you don't
		want to miss.
